# Watch What App

The purpose of this project is to create an application which follows the requirements listed in the brief and achieves the objective of the project. In order to accomplish this, I have decided to create an app called '*Watch What*' which allows viewers to see my reviews on tv shows that I have watched.
The purpose of this app will help recommend shows to viewers based off my reviews. They will also have the option to create an account which will allow them to add or edit any comments under my reviews.

# Introduction
The purpose of the 'Watch What' app will help recommend shows to viewers based off my reviews.

## Requirements
The following is the minimum set of requirements for the project:
* A Jira board with user stories, use cases and tasks.
* Documentation describing the architecture used in the project.
* Risk assessment.
* Relational database used to store data from project.
* Functional application.
* Front-end website and integrated API.
* Testing implementation.
* Code integrated into a Version Control System.
* Application deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

## Features in the App

The Watch What app will show reviews of tv-shows added to the app. 

The home page will contain buttons which will lead users to a page where they can create, read, update and delete reviews.

The app will have search-by options for 'review ID', 'Genre' and 'Rating'. 


# Objective

The objective of this project is to create a CRUD application utilising the tools, methodologies and technologies discussed during the modules taught during training.
This CRUD app will allow the user to create, read, update and delete items on the webapp.

## Meeting the Objective
In order to achieve the objectives, I have created a simple app called *Watch What*. This app will create a list of shows reviewed by myself. 
This app will allow users to do the following:
* Create a new review (user: me) which will include the following information:
    * Name of show
    * Genre
    * Rating
    * Summary of show

* View the information submitted in the review (user: anyone)
* Update the information in the reviews (user: me), this can include:
    * Editing information already uploaded
    * Making any corrections (i.e. Grammar, spelling etc.)
* Delete any reviews that have been uploaded (user: me)







# Risk Assessment
Link to the full risk assessment can be found here:

The screenshot of the risk assessment shows the potential risks that could occur from the app. It is important to assess these risks and plan ahead by implementing features that could prevent it.
