# Watch What App

The purpose of this project is to create an application which follows the requirements listed in the brief and achieves the objective of the project. In order to accomplish this, I have decided to create an app called '*Watch What*' which allows viewers to see my reviews on tv shows that I have watched.
The purpose of this app will help recommend shows to viewers based off my reviews.

# Introduction
## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a CRUD application utilising the tools, methodologies and technologies discussed during the modules taught during training.
This CRUD app will allow the user to create, read, update and delete items on the webapp.

## Requirements

## Features in the App

The Watch What app will show reviews of tv-shows added to the app. 
When on the home-page, the website will include a list of shows with information including:
* Name of the show
* Genre of the show
* Rating out of 5

After clicking on the name of the show, a new webpage will appear showing extra information of the selected show which includes:
* Short summary
* Criticms
* Image

Since the app will only have my reviews, therefore, I am the only one who can add, edit or delete reviews. To ensure this, I will add a password to the add, edit and delete buttons on the website.

Viewers of the app can press a 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down' button to show whether they agree or disagree with the review. This will have a count next to it to show how many people agree or disagree with the app. Clicking a button will change the colour to present their vote and add to the corresponding vote count. Clicking the same button again will delete their vote from the count and change the colour back to the original.

The app will have drop-down menus for 'Genre' and 'Rating'. 
The app will automatically list shows in alphabetical order however, this can be changed to be sorted by highest rating or lowest rating.

## Meeting the Objective

In order to achieve the [objective](#Objective) , I have created a simple app called *Watch What*. This app will create a list of shows reviewed by myself. 
This app will allow users to do the following:
* Create a new review (user: me) which will include the following information:
    * Name of show
    * Genre
    * Rating
    * Summary of show
    * Criticism
    * An image
* View the information submitted in the review (user: anyone)
* Update the information in the reviews (user: me), this can include:
    * Editing information already uploaded
    * Making any corrections (i.e. Grammar, spelling etc.)
    * Changing the image
* Delete any reviews that have been uploaded (user: me)
* Create a new vote through the thumbs up/down button (user: anyone) which will update the vote count.
* View the number of votes for each thumb up/down button.
* Update a vote by clicking the same button and then selecting the other thumbs up/down option to change their vote (user: anyone) which will remove their vote from the count. However, the user can only change their vote that they previously selected.
* Delete a vote (user: anyone) by clicking the same button and not re-selecting another vote option. This will remove a vote count.
